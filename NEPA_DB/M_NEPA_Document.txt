CBFWA produced the PDEIS for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, National Marine Fisheries Service, and BPA.  The agencies intended to use the PFEIS to guide development of an overall federal strategy for artificial production of anadromous fish in the Columbia River Basin.  The Independent Scientific Advisory Board (ISAB) was tasked by NMFS and the Northwest Power Planning Council (now the Northwest Power and Conservation Council) to review and provide comment on the scientific and technical aspects of the PDEIS.  In April 1997, the ISAB found the PDEIS substantially flawed and technically incomplete.  Their report stated the PDEIS had too many shortcomings to adequately guide future program development for artificial production in the Columbia River Basin and noted that a revision of the PDEIS was not likely to lead to a PFEIS that could be used to meet the identified objectives.  That EIS was never finalized.""",,0,,0,0,,,0,7/25/1994 0:00:00,,,
